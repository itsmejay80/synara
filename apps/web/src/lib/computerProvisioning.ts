// FILE: computerProvisioning.ts
// Purpose: One vocabulary for "set up computer control" — the toasts the chat card
//          raises, the inline note the settings panel renders, and the rule for what
//          counts as done. Pure so both surfaces can be pinned by tests.
// Layer: Web UI logic
// Exports: computerProvisionOutcome, computerProvisionStartToast, computerProvisionResultToast,
//          computerProvisionNote
//
// The card and the panel used to each own a private copy of this flow, and they
// said different things about the same server call: one raised a toast the other
// did not, one had no pending state, and the two could fire the underlying
// provision concurrently. The state machine lives in `useProvisionComputer`; the
// words live here.
